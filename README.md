# Neural Networks from scratch

Going through Andrej Karpathy's NN from scratch series (~13 hours)

Look at my [progress](progress.md)

## installations

```bash
brew install graphviz
```

## Building micrograd (currently doing)

What? A tiny scalar-valued autograd engine and a neural net library on top of it with PyTorch-like API

- [Code](micrograd)
- [Notes](micrograd/notes.md) on the lectures

## Building makemore

TODO
